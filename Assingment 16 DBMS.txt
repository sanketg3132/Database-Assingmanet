1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.
SQL
===
	create index i_date on orders(Odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
SQL
===
	alter table orders add constraint U_Onum unique(Onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.
SQL
===
	create index i_date on salespeople(Snum);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
SQL
===

     alter table customers add constraint C_rating unique(rating);
