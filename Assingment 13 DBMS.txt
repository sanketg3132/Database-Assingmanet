1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
   customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
   Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”
SOl
====
	select Cname,city,rating,"high rating" from customers where rating>=200 union select Cname,city,rating,"low rating" from customers where rating<200;
	
2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
   each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
   order
SOl
====
	select Cname,Cnum from customers  where Cnum in(select Cnum from orders group by Cnum having count(*)>1)
        union
        select Sname,Snum from salespeople  where Snum in(select Snum from orders group by Snum having count(*)>1) order by Cname;

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
   San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
   onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
   but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
   (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
   besides the point.)
SOl
====

	select distinct Snum from salespeople where city='San Jose'
        union 
        select distinct Cnum from customers where city='San Jose'
        union all
        select Onum from orders where Odate='1990-10-03';
