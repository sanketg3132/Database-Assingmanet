1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum 
   fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers table, 
   so that each customerâ€™s order will be entered into this table along with his or her city.
   Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in Cityorders will be 
   constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume the parent keys in these 
   tables already have the proper constraints.
SQL
===
      create table cityorders
      select onum,amt,snum,cnum,city
      from orders join customer;

    alter table cityorders add constraint C_Onum_pk primary key(onum);


2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will
   identify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current customer. 
   Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. The foreign key 
   should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite enforced link 
   between the current order and the one referenced.
SQL
===
	alter table orders add perv int;
        alter table orders add constraint O_prev_fk foreign key(prev) references orders(onum);
        alter table orders add constraint o_cnum_fk foreign key(cnum) references customer(cnum);
